Problem:

Mahe and Mani are playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the sum of the odd number and the even number. Write a program to help them to solve the puzzle game.

Input Format

Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

Refer to the sample output for details.

Sample Input 0

5
2
3
6
8
-1
Sample Output 0

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16
The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2

Solution:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int arr[]=new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }int e=0;
        int o=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]%2==0){
                e=e+arr[i];
            }else{
                o=o+arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println("The sum of the even numbers in the array is "+e);
        System.out.print("The sum of the odd numbers in the array is "+o);
    }
