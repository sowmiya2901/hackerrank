solution:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int arr[]=new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){

                    int t=arr[i];
                    arr[i]=arr[j];
